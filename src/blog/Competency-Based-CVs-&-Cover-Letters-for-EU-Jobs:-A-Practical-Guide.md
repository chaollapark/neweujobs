Competency-based applications are now standard across many EU jobs, including roles in Brussels, EU institutions, public affairs, NGOs, and trade associations. Instead of listing duties, you prove capabilities with concrete results. This guide shows how to craft a competency-based CV and cover letter that align with the job, pass screening, and win interviews.

## What “Competency-Based” Actually Means

Competency-based hiring evaluates the skills and behaviors that predict success: problem-solving, communication, stakeholder management, analysis, adaptability, leadership, and delivery. In EU contexts, you’ll often see frameworks aligned with policy/legal analysis, stakeholder engagement, project delivery, and language skills.

Your job: extract the target competencies from the vacancy, then provide short, outcome-focused evidence for each.

## FAQs

**One page or two?**  
One page for early careers; two pages fine if every line earns its place.

**Do I include metrics if I can’t share numbers?**  
Use directional impact: “reduced prep time,” “improved response rate,” “supported adoption,” plus ranges (e.g., 20–30%) where allowed.

**How do I adapt for legal roles?**  
Lean on treaty/case-law analysis, drafting precision, and risk/compliance outcomes. Add one concrete example per legal competency.

**Which languages matter in Brussels?**  
English baseline; French is the most helpful add-on. Dutch/German/Italian/Spanish widen sector options.

**Salary context for Belgium?**

 and Minimum salary in Belgium

## Identify the Right Competencies (Fast)

Mine the vacancy for verbs and nouns: “analyze,” “coordinate,” “draft,” “advise,” “stakeholders,” “trilogues,” “impact assessment,” “CSRD,” “competition,” “state aid,” “legislation.”

Group them into 5–7 headings (e.g., Analysis, Writing, Stakeholder Engagement, Project Delivery, Languages, Tools).

Prioritize evidence that mirrors the role’s scope and sector.
